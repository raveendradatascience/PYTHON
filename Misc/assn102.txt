10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


sample code
==========
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
counts = dict()
for line in fh:
    lst=list()
    nospln=line.rstrip()
    if (nospln.startswith("From ")) :
        words=nospln.split()
        for word in words :
            tmp=word.split(':')
            for t in tmp :
                lst.append(t)
    if lst[5] in counts :
        counts[lst[5]]=counts[lst[5]]+1
    else :
        counts[lst[5]] = 1
lt=counts.items()
lt=lt.sort()
print lt
