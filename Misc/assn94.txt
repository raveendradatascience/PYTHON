9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.



fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fh:
    nospln=line.rstrip()
    if nospln.startswith("From ") :
        splitwd=nospln.split()
        counts= dict()
        for word in splitwd:
            counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1
bigcount = None
bigword = None
for word,count in counts.items():
    if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
        bigword = word
        bigcount = count  
print bigword,bigcount
